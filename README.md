# Haskell Factorial Calculator

This repository contains a simple Haskell program that calculates the factorial of a given number. The program demonstrates the use of a recursive function to compute the factorial.

## How to Use

1. Save the code in a file with the extension `.hs`, for example, `factorial.hs`.
2. Install GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) if you haven't already.
3. Compile the program using the following commands:

    ```bash
    ghc -o factorial factorial.hs
    ```

4. Run the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./factorial
    ```

5. Enter a number when prompted, and the program will display the factorial.

## Code Explanation

- **factorial:** This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number.

- **main:** The main function interacts with the user, reads input, calls the `factorial` function, and prints the result.

The Haskell language is known for its functional purity, laziness, and strong static typing. This example demonstrates some of the fundamental concepts of Haskell.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your learning or experimentation needs.
